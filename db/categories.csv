Home Efficiency;High Environmental Impact - Buildings consume substantial energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Improving home energy efficiency through insulation, smart technologies, and renewable energy sources helps reduce carbon emissions and decrease energy consumption. The carbon emissions resulting from inefficient home energy usage depend on factors such as heating, cooling, and electricity consumption. On average, residential energy usage contributes to around 5.5 metric tons of CO2 per year. Enhancing home energy efficiency through insulation, renewable energy, and energy-saving measures can significantly reduce these emissions.;https://res.cloudinary.com/dd45bmmjg/image/upload/v1686488370/home_Energy_consumption_category_ynahew.jpg;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Green Gardening;Moderate Environmental Impact - Traditional gardening practices can lead to water waste, soil degradation, and the use of harmful chemicals. Encouraging sustainable gardening methods like organic practices, water-wise techniques, and native plant cultivation promotes biodiversity and conserves resources. The carbon emissions associated with gardening primarily come from water usage, fossil fuel-based fertilizers, and transportation of gardening products. On average, a household's gardening emissions amount to around 0.8 metric tons of CO2 per year. Embracing sustainable gardening practices like organic methods, water conservation, and reducing chemical inputs can help lower these emissions.;https://res.cloudinary.com/dd45bmmjg/image/upload/v1686488370/green_garding_category_mqv1cj.jpg;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Conscious Consumerism;Moderate Environmental Impact - Consumer choices impact resource consumption, pollution, and waste generation. Encouraging conscious consumerism, including buying eco-friendly products, supporting ethical brands, and reducing overconsumption, promotes a more sustainable and responsible lifestyle. The carbon emissions resulting from consumer choices depend on factors such as product manufacturing, transportation, and disposal. On average, an individual's consumer-related emissions account for around 2 metric tons of CO2 per year. By adopting conscious consumer habits, supporting sustainable brands, and reducing overall consumption, these emissions can be minimized.;https://res.cloudinary.com/dd45bmmjg/image/upload/v1686488370/consumerism_category_chuihl.jpg;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
